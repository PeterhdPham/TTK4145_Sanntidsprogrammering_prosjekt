# Elevator Project

## Overview
This project involves creating software for controlling `n` elevators working in parallel across `m` floors. The main goal is to ensure that once the light on a hall call button is turned on, an elevator should arrive at that floor. Similarly, for a cab call, but only the elevator at that specific workspace should take the order.

## Getting Started
Instructions on how to get a copy of the project up and running on the local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

### Installation
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

## Structure
The project has the following structure:

- `src/main.go`: This is the main file that runs the application.
- `src/pack/`: This directory contains separate Go files for each module. Each file is briefly described below:
    - `functions.go`: Contains functions that main.go imports and uses.
    - `test.go`: Another file (not important).

Whenever a team member adds a feature or file, they should write a quick explanation here.

## Running the tests
